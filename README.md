# Quaternion Heading Issue
In this repository, I uploaded the code I used for quaternion calculations. To compute the quaternion in the code, I used the Madgwick algorithm with a magnetometer. I believe the calculations are quite successful because they produce rational values consistent with the theory. Furthermore, the quaternion values can be visualized using a 3D Cube, which can be found on GitHub. The sensor's rotation aligns with the visualization, provided that the magnetometer's X-axis points north when the code is first run; otherwise, the sensor's rotation will not match the 3D Cube visualization.

I assume that the issue requiring the magnetometer's X-axis to face north at the first run is because the sensor cannot detect the north direction in this quaternion calculation. This assumption is based on experiments where I ran the program multiple times with the magnetometer's X-axis pointing in different directions. However, the quaternion value always remains at 1,0,0,0 (not absolute but close to that value).

The sensor calibration I performed was only on the gyroscope and magnetometer. For the gyroscope, I used bias correction calibration, and for the magnetometer, I used soft iron and hard iron calibration. I did not calibrate the accelerometer because I believe its values are already accurate.

To better understand this issue, I uploaded four videos illustrating how I ran my program, how I calibrated the sensors, the initial position of the sensor, and the 3D Cube simulation using Python.

## Demo Video

There are two groups of videos below. The first group consists of simulation videos where the magnetometer's X-axis faces north, and the second group consists of simulation videos where the magnetometer's X-axis faces east. I uploaded two videos for each group due to equipment limitations.

The zoom view videos offer high quality for observing the visuals clearly, but there is a delay between the sensor and the visualization due to internet speed. Meanwhile, the camera view videos are better for comparing the sensor simulation with the visualization without any delay.

From the videos above where the magnetometer's X-axis faces north, the initial quaternion values correspond to the sensor's position, namely 1,0,0,0. The simulation using the 3D Cube also aligns with the movements in Python.

From the videos above where the magnetometer's X-axis faces north, the initial quaternion values when the sensor is first powered on are 1,0,0,0. Similarly, the quaternion values are also 1,0,0,0 when the magnetometer's X-axis faces east. This is the issue I am questioningâ€”why does this happen? I believe the magnetometer values should differ when the X-axis faces north and east, so the quaternion values should also be different.
